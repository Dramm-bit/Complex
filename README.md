## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Java
- Spring
- Postgres
- Loombook
- Maven


### What I learned

In this project I had to remember different concepts that I took for granted, so well I got into this and tried my best, I had never worked with Spring so this put me in a little trouble but with help I was able to overcome it, I guess working 100% virtually with my partner via github gave me a better handle on this, I also learned how important it is to know SQL queries.
